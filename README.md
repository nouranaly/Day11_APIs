# Week 3-Fintech
## Day 11: APIs
#### Overview
**Students will be able to** 
- Explain what an API is 
- Go to a developers website for an API and get a Key
- Retrieve data by making GET requests to a specified endpoint 
- Make a request with parameters
- Parse through JSON responses (lists and dictionaries) from an API
- Explore data structure to isolate the elements that you want and build an API/Flask App

### Intro 
**Framing**

At the start of instruction frame for students that some of them may have worked with APIs before and for others, today will be their first day! For that purpose, API play time will give everyone a chance to explore APIs and build something new that they have not tried before. Expect that students will be at different levels today and be willing to provide the space for them to choose their own route for how they want to build and play with APIs. 

**What is an API**

An API is an *application programming interface*. It refers to connection points between 2 entities of code. Think of it as a set of rules that allows programs to talk to each other. Computer programs frequently need to communicate amongst themselves and APIs are one way they do that. Every time you go online shopping, browse a social media app, play a game on your smartphone, or visit a page online, you’re interacting with an API. A more specific example is when you’re listening to music on Spotify, the music playing application on Spotify communicated with your systems API in order to send music to your speaker. 

To use an API, you make a request to a remote web server and retrieve the data you need. 

**But why use an API?**

It’s worth taking time in the beginning of class to have students construct their own understanding of why APIs are useful. 
Before heading into the Giphy API Lab, have students go through the process of building a program that returns a gif based on the users query **WITHOUT** the use of an api.
